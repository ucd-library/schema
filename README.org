* UCD Library Schema

  The Library's linked schema definitions.


** Goals

   This repository is designed to provide both documentation and programmatic
   support for the the library's linked data platform.  By support we mean:


*** Website
      maintaining https://schema.library.ucdavis.edu which is a website, matching
      to some extent the UC Davis web standards that give a brief summary of the
      applications that use linked data, fin, dams, aggie experts.


*** Property / Object Catalog

    A catalog somewhat similar to https://schema.org/ that describes each
      individual predicate and objects that are used in the the projects.  For
      example, https://schema.library.ucdavis.edu/is-open-access might point to
      something that says:


    *is-open-access* is a property of type [[http://schema.org/Property][schema:Property]].

    Describes whether the content of a [[http://schema.library.ucdavis.edu/work][work]] is available via some open-access
    mechanism.

    | Values expected to be on of these types |
    |-----------------------------------------|
    | boolean                                 |

    | Used on these types |
    |---------------------|
    | work                |


*** Linked data definition of a the catalog

    Defining an owl type definition for the those properties.  For example
      (although this is not right )

 #+begin_src json
   { "@context": {
       "@base":"http://schema.library.ucdavis.edu/",
       "schema":"http://schema.org/"
       },
     "@graph":[
         {
         "@id":"is-open-access",
         "@type":["schema:Property"],
         "domain":["boolean"],
         "range":["work"]
         }
   ]
   }
 #+end_src


*** Context files

    One important part of the using linked data in [[https://jsonld.org][JSON-LD]], is the proper
    creation of a ~@context~ for the document.  This can be used to support
    compaction and expansion of documents, as well as framing data in for
    programmatic use.  We would like there to be a catalog of ~@context~ files,
    as well, where for example, going to
    http://schema.library.ucdavis.edu/@context/dams.json

    responds with:

    #+begin_src json
{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab":"http://schema.org/",
    "fast": "http://id.worldcat.org/fast/",
    "fedora":"http://fedora.info/definitions/v4/repository#",
    "rdf": "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#",
    "schema": "http://schema.org/",
    "shelfmark":"ark:/87287/d7r94j/",
    "xsd": "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#",
    "ucdlib":"http://digital.ucdavis.edu/schema#",
    "ldp":"http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#",
    "about": {
      "@type":"@id"
    },
    "datePublished":{
      "@type":"xsd:date"
    },
    "yearPublished":{
      "@id":"datePublished",
      "@type":"xsd:gYear"
    },
    "sdDatePublished":{
      "@type":"xsd:date"
    },
    "sdYearPublished":{
      "@id":"sdDatePublished",
      "@type":"xsd:gYear"
    },
    "identifier":{"@type":"@id"},
    "isPartOf":{"@type":"@id"},
    "image":{"@type":"@id"},
    "license":{"@type":"@id"},
    "sdLicense":{"@type":"@id"},
    "sdPublisher":{"@type":"@id"},
    "publisher":{"@type":"@id"},
    "name":{
      "@language":"en"
    },
    "ldp:membershipResource":{"@type":"@id"},
    "ldp:isMemberOfRelation":{"@type":"@id"},
    "ldp:hasMemberOfRelation":{"@type":"@id"}
  }
}
    #+end_src

    In this fashion, metadata creators can create more simple documents as in:

    #+begin_src json
      {
        "@context": "https://schema.library.ucdavis.edu/@context/dams",
        "@id": "",
        "@type": [
          "fedora:ArchivalGroup",
          "CreativeWork",
          "Menu"
        ],
        "about": [
          "fast:1424061",
          "fast:893952"
        ],
        "yearPublished": "1960",
        "datePublished": "1960-09-07",
        "identifier": [
          "ark:/87287/d7002v",
          "shelfmark:D-060/box:60+folder:112"
        ],
        "image": "ark:/87287/d7002v/media/images/d7002v-0",
        "isPartOf": "https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8xd13fg/",
        "license": "http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/CNE/1.0/",
        "name": "Drake-Wiltshire Hotel (San Francisco, California): Un DÃ®ner d'Automne"
      }
    #+end_src

    We should provide multiple contexts, on an application basis, and we should
    also provide ~@contexts~ for any standard data framing that we will be
    doing for applications.

*** Higher Level Object Definitions

    We can also provide support for higher level defintions, for example giving
    a more complete idea of what a [[http://schema.library.ucdavis.edu/Person][:Person]] is, and what features are
    expected. This can be a combination of both an informative description,
    along with more technical descriptions, for example, these
   notes about linked data shape expressions, There are both, [[https://shex.io/][SHeX (2019)]] which is
   implemented in [[https://jena.apache.org/documentation/shex/][Jena 4.2]], and [[https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/][SHACL]] (2017), also in [[https://jena.apache.org/documentation/shacl/][JENA SHACL]].


*** Versioning

    We should provide an implicit but also explicit versions for our linked
    data definitions

*** Communication

    We should use the issue tracking framework to manage the discussions on how
    the decisions we made on our schema.
