### Project Overview

[Aggie Experts](https://rc.experts.ucdavis.edu/) is a joint pilot project between the Office of the Provost and the UC Davis Library team. Its purpose is to create a central registry of UC Davis scholarship produced by faculty, researchers, experts and creators. Aggie Experts can be used as an expertise discovery platform for finding collaborators, mentors and expert opinions, as a showcase of the UC Davis excellence in research, teaching and community service, and as a tool that reduces the administrative load on UC Davis researchers and administrators. In the course of two years (2020-2022) we will be expanding the registry by adding faculty from the College of Engineering and adjusting its functionality based on user feedback.

### Infrastructure

The overarching principles of building out the Aggie Experts platform are to avoid hosting data locally and to present all content as linked data. The data sources are described in more detail below. Aggie Experts is inspired by the [VIVO software tool](https://duraspace.org/vivo/about/) and uses their schema to represent the data in RDF format. For more information, refer to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ucd-library/rp-ucd-deployment).
