[UC Davis Library Schema](https://schema.library.ucdavis.edu) describes the
linked data schemas and custom properties and objects used in Library
applications and developed by the UC Davis Library
[team](team.md). 

## Projects 

### Aggie Experts

The Aggie Experts project uses a standard
[context](https://ucd-library.github.io/schema/aggie_experts/context.json) file
that can be used for many of the JSON-LD documents.

In addition, the project often uses a standard JSON-LD
[frame](https://ucd-library.github.io/schema/aggie_experts/frame.json) that is
primarily used to embedd some minor objects.
